title: About
---

Most people know me as a programmer.
I've been developing mobile apps since the month the App Store launched,
but I spend most of my time these days on backend software and libraries.
I love startups, and have co-founded a few.
I've worked in industries ranging from streaming media to finance and even agriculture.
My day job (and nights and weekends too sometimes) is [Stadia Maps](https://stadiamaps.com/).
