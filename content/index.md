Welcome to my site.
I occasionally post things here.

Most people know me as a programmer.
I've been developing mobile apps since the month the App Store launched.
I love startups, and have co-founded a few.
I've worked in industries ranging from streaming media to finance and even agriculture.
My day job (and nights and weekends too sometimmes) is [Stadia Maps](https://stadiamaps.com/).


# About this site

This is my site.
I occasionally post things here.
You can find longer form content under the [Blog](blog) section.
The [TIL](til) section contains shorter bits that I recently learned or rediscovered,
which I think you might find interesting too!

Follow me on your favorite channel or subscribe to the RSS feed
if you want to learn when I post something new.
Links in the footer.
