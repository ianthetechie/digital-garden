Welcome to my site.
I occasionally post things here.

# About me

Most people know me as a programmer.
I've been developing mobile apps since the month the App Store launched.
I love startups, and have co-founded a few.
I've worked in industries ranging from streaming media to finance and even agriculture.
My day job (and nights and weekends too sometimmes) is [Stadia Maps](https://stadiamaps.com/).
