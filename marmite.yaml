    bio: |
      Most people know me as a programmer.
      I’ve been developing mobile apps since the month the App Store launched, but spend most of my time on backend software and libraries these days.
      I love startups, and have even co-founded a few!
      I’ve worked in industries ranging from streaming media to finance and even agriculture.
      My current day job (and nights and weekends too sometimmes) is Stadia Maps.
